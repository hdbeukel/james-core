/**
 * Tabu search algorithm using first-best-admissible move strategy. 
 * In every search step, shuffle the list of moves and then iterate over all moves. If a valid neighbour that is better 
 * than the current solution is found, it is adopted as the new solution. Otherwise, the best valid and non-tabu neighbour 
 * is adopted, even if it is no improvement over the current solution, which is the same as the ordinary tabu search.
 * To avoid repeatedly revisiting the same solutions, moves might be declared tabu based on a tabu memory.
 * This memory dynamically tracks (a limited number of) recently visited solutions, features of these solutions and/or
 * recently applied moves (i.e. recently modified features). If a move is tabu, it is not considered, unless it yields
 * a solution which is better than the best solution found so far (aspiration criterion).
 * <p>
 * If all valid neighbours of the current solution are tabu and no valid neighbours are better than the current solution, 
 * the search stops. Note that this may never happen so that a stop criterion should preferably be set to ensure termination.
 * 
 * @param <SolutionType> solution type of the problems that may be solved using this search, required to extend {@link Solution}
